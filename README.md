## About

vibe-mofa is an innovative conceptual framework designed to bring vibrant experiences to MoFA applications.

## Pain point

Vibing with certainty and  consistent results is not easy:
1. How to write functional code
2. How to create proper mofa nodes
3. How to generate correct mofa flows
What's more,
4. How to effectively, incrementally improve all components: vibing in a sustainable manner.

Even more, 
5.How to make the vibing a collaborative and promising. 

## How vibe-mofa work

vibe-mofa integrated SSD and LLM Skills, making vibing a systematic framework for defining the principles, methods, to technologies and resources, from very abstract level to very fine granual details. 

With Vibe MoFA, vibing is not only about SSD and/or LLM skills, it becomes:

- Sustainable Vibing
- Team Vibing
- Systematic Vibing
